      Contains routines responsible for reversing the bits within a
      data byte from MSB to LSB and vice versa.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: inv_bytes - takes an array of bytes and inverts them using a
#cat:             lookup table. invert = reverse bits within a byte

***********************************************************************/
#include "invbyte.h"

void inv_bytes(unsigned char *data, int nbytes)
{
   for ( ; nbytes ; nbytes--, data++ )
      *data = Inv_Byte[*data];
}
